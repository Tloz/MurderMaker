#Welcome to the MPF format specifications.

The Murder Party File format is an open format intended to easily create or adapt murder party scenarios in order to be used with MurderPlayer or any other software that has no other purpose than spending a nice moment with friends.

The MPF is essentially a sqlite database, with some constraints.

There must be a table called MPF featuring format specific information.
